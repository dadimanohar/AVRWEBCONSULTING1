      { question: "Will a redesign always drop my rankings?", answer: "No. A well-executed migration usually sees a brief fluctuation and then recovery, often above the previous baseline if speed and content improve." },
      { question: "Should I change URLs during a redesign?", answer: "Only when necessary. Every changed URL costs some equity in transfer, so keep the existing structure unless it is genuinely harmful." },
      { question: "How long should redirects stay in place?", answer: "Permanently where possible, and at minimum one year. Old links keep sending traffic long after the change." },
      { question: "When should I involve SEO in a redesign?", answer: "At the wireframe stage. Fixing SEO after a design is signed off is far more expensive than designing with it in mind." },
      { question: "What is the most common migration mistake?", answer: "Launching with the staging noindex tag still in place, followed closely by redirecting everything to the homepage." },

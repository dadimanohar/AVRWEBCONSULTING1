    { question: "What is your minimum ad budget?", answer: "We work with media budgets from about $500 per month. Below that, search volume is usually too thin to gather statistically useful data, and we will normally recommend putting the money into local SEO and Google Business Profile work first." },
    { question: "How much do you charge to manage Google Ads?", answer: "Management starts at $150 per month for small local accounts and moves to 10–15% of media spend for accounts above $5,000 per month. The fee is quoted upfront and does not change without your written approval." },
    { question: "Who owns the ad accounts?", answer: "You do. We always build campaigns inside your own Google Ads, Meta Business and LinkedIn accounts, and you keep full admin access. If we ever part ways, your history, pixels and audiences stay with you." },
    { question: "How quickly can campaigns go live?", answer: "Typically five business days: two for tracking and account structure, two for copy and landing page review, one for launch checks. Rush launches for events or seasonal sales can be done in 48 hours." },
    { question: "Do you run ads and SEO together?", answer: "Yes, and that is where the compounding happens. Paid search reveals which keywords actually convert within weeks, so the SEO content plan targets proven revenue terms instead of guesses, and organic winners become tested ad copy." },
    { question: "How do you report performance?", answer: "A weekly one-page summary covering spend, conversions, cost per acquisition and what changed, plus a monthly deep dive with search-term analysis, creative performance and next month's plan. All data lives in a dashboard you can open any time." },
    { question: "Can you fix an account another agency built?", answer: "Yes. Roughly half of new paid clients arrive with an existing account. We audit structure, tracking accuracy, wasted spend and query relevance first, and usually restructure rather than rebuild so historical learning is preserved." },
    { question: "Do you handle international campaigns?", answer: "We run campaigns targeting India, the United States, United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates and Europe, including multi-currency accounts, localised copy and region-specific landing pages with correct hreflang." },
    { question: "What conversion tracking do you set up?", answer: "GA4 events, Google Ads conversion actions with enhanced conversions, Meta CAPI where relevant, call tracking for phone-led businesses and CRM offline conversion import so the platforms optimise toward qualified leads rather than raw form fills." },
    { question: "Is there a lock-in contract?", answer: "No. Paid advertising is billed month to month with 30 days' notice. We would rather keep accounts because performance justifies it than because a contract traps you." },

Competitive B2B or multi-city campaigns usually need $2,000+ per month before the data is reliable enough to optimise confidently." },
    { question: "Is Performance Max worth running?", answer: "It is, once you have at least 30 conversions a month and clean conversion values. Before that it tends to spend on brand and remarketing traffic you would have won anyway, which inflates reported ROAS while adding little incremental revenue." },
    { question: "Why is my cost per click so high?", answer: "Usually a mix of low Quality Score from weak message match, over-broad match types, and bidding on head terms instead of specific commercial phrases. Improving landing page relevance and tightening keywords typically brings CPCs down within a few weeks." },
    { question: "Do you write the ad copy?", answer: "Yes. We write responsive search ads with pinned value propositions, test four headline angles at a time and rewrite based on asset performance, not opinion. Copy is reviewed with you before it goes live." },
    { question: "Can you manage Google Shopping feeds?", answer: "Yes. We handle Merchant Center setup, feed diagnostics, title and attribute optimisation, custom labels for margin-based bidding, and supplemental feeds for missing GTINs or product highlights." },
    { question: "How do you measure phone leads?", answer: "Through Google call extensions, dynamic call tracking numbers on landing pages and, for longer sales cycles, offline conversion import from your CRM so the algorithm learns which calls actually became customers." },
    { question: "How often do you optimise the account?", answer: "Search terms and budget pacing are reviewed weekly; bidding strategy, ad copy and structure are reviewed monthly. Bigger structural changes are proposed with a rationale, not applied silently." },
    { question: "Will ads help my SEO rankings?", answer: "Not directly — paid clicks are not a ranking factor. Indirectly they help a lot, because ads tell you within weeks which keywords convert, so your SEO investment goes into pages with proven commercial value." },
    { question: "Do you run ads in multiple countries?", answer: "Yes, including India, the US, UK, UAE and European markets. Each country gets its own campaign, currency handling, localised copy and, where needed, a country-specific landing page." },
    { question: "What happens in the first 30 days?", answer: "Week one: tracking audit and account build. Week two: launch and daily monitoring. Weeks three and four: search-term pruning, bid strategy tuning and the first copy test. You receive a full performance review at day 30 with the plan for month two." },

    { question: "How much budget do I need for Meta ads?", answer: "Around $20–$30 per day per active test lets a campaign exit the learning phase within a couple of weeks. Below that, results swing wildly and it becomes hard to tell a bad creative from an unlucky week." },

For services with a customer worth several thousand dollars, LinkedIn frequently produces the cheapest qualified pipeline because you can target by job title, company size and industry with real precision." },

Paid social builds branded search demand and third-party conversation about your brand, and both branded queries and independent mentions are signals that AI assistants weigh when deciding which companies to name in an answer." },
    { question: "How do you handle iOS tracking limits?", answer: "With Conversions API, server-side tagging, aggregated event measurement configuration and modelled comparisons against your CRM data. We assume platform numbers overstate and validate against real revenue before scaling." },
    { question: "What reporting do I get?", answer: "A weekly summary of spend, leads and cost per result plus creative-level performance, and a monthly review covering audience saturation, next creative concepts and budget recommendations." },
    { question: "Can you run ads in multiple languages?", answer: "Yes. We run English campaigns across all our markets and can produce Hindi, Telugu and Arabic variants where the audience responds better in a local language." },
    { question: "How soon will I see leads?", answer: "Most accounts see first leads within the opening week, but the honest read on cost per acquisition comes after two to three weeks, once the algorithm has exited learning and at least three creative concepts have had a fair share of budget." },

    { question: "Which platforms should my business be on?", answer: "Two done well beat five done poorly. Local services and D2C usually pick Instagram and Facebook; B2B and SaaS pick LinkedIn and YouTube. We choose based on where your buyers already spend attention, then commit to consistency there." },
    { question: "How often should we post?", answer: "Four to six times a week on the primary platform, with at least two short-form videos. Consistency matters more than volume — an unpredictable feed loses reach far faster than a modest but regular one." },
    { question: "Do you create video content?", answer: "Yes. We script, edit, caption and format short-form video. We can work from footage your team records on a phone, from existing webinar or event material, or from stock and motion graphics where filming is impractical." },
    { question: "Will you post from our accounts?", answer: "Yes, with scheduled publishing through your own business accounts. You keep ownership and admin rights, and every calendar is approved by you before anything goes live." },
    { question: "Does organic social affect SEO?", answer: "Not as a direct ranking factor, but strongly as a demand generator. Social drives branded search, earns links from people who discovered you there, and produces the third-party mentions AI models use when deciding who to recommend." },
    { question: "How long before social shows results?", answer: "Engagement usually improves within four to six weeks of consistent posting. Follower growth and referral traffic typically become meaningful around month three, and branded search lift shows around months four to six." },
    { question: "Do you handle negative comments?", answer: "Yes. We reply to routine complaints using an approved tone and escalation guide, and anything sensitive — legal, medical or safety-related — is escalated to your team immediately rather than answered on the fly." },
    { question: "Can you grow followers quickly?", answer: "We do not buy followers or use engagement pods, because a bloated follower count with dead engagement suppresses reach and misleads your reporting. Growth here is earned through content that people save and share." },
    { question: "What do you need from us each month?", answer: "About an hour: approving the calendar, sending any product or event updates, and ideally recording a few short clips. The more raw material you can give us, the more distinctive the output." },
    { question: "Can social be bundled with SEO?", answer: "Yes, and it is our most popular combination. The same keyword and question research powers both, so the blog, the FAQ hub and the social calendar all reinforce one consistent set of brand facts." },

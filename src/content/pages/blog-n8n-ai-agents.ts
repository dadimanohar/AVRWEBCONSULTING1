This evolution from traditional automation to AI-driven agentic workflows is reshaping how businesses manage their online presence."),

They are not just executing code; they are solving problems."),

It operates on a node-based architecture where data flows seamlessly from one step to the next."),
      p("The foundational structure of any n8n workflow involves a clear progression: Trigger, Process, Decision, and Action. A trigger initiates the sequence (e.g., a web-hook receiving data, a schedule firing, or an email arriving). The processing nodes manipulate the data (parsing JSON, extracting text). Decision nodes route the workflow based on conditions (if the sentiment is negative, route to support). Finally, action nodes interact with external systems (updating a CRM, sending a Slack message, or querying a database)."),

  faqs: [
    { question: "What is the difference between traditional automation and an AI agent?", answer: "Traditional automation follows strict if/then rules and fails outside those parameters. AI agents use LLMs to understand objectives, dynamically select tools, and formulate plans to achieve goals, allowing them to handle ambiguity." },
    { question: "When did n8n introduce native Agents?", answer: "n8n officially launched its native Agents features in preview in late September 2026, integrating memory, tools, and sub-agent orchestration directly into the platform." },
    { question: "Can an AI agent rank my website on page one?", answer: "No. AI agents do not control search algorithms. They can significantly improve the efficiency of your SEO research, auditing, and content generation, but traditional ranking factors still apply." },
    { question: "What was announced at OpenAI DevDay in September 2026?", answer: "OpenAI announced the new Agents API, OpenAI Dots (always-on background agents), GPT-6.1 Sol, and the impending shutdown of the older Agent Builder interface." },
    { question: "What is Claude Cowork?", answer: "Claude Cowork is Anthropic's desktop agentic workflow system designed for automating tasks like morning briefings, reporting dashboards, and ad audits." },
    { question: "Why should I use workflows as tools for agents?", answer: "Using workflows as tools provides a strict security boundary. It ensures the agent can only interact with external systems through pre-defined, heavily validated, and secure processes, preventing malicious or accidental actions." },
    { question: "What is a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)?", answer: "HITL is a security design where an AI agent must pause and request explicit human approval before executing high-risk actions, such as sending emails or spending money." },
    { question: "What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?", answer: "MCP is a standardized protocol used by platforms like n8n and Anthropic to securely connect AI models to external data sources and tools." },
    { question: "How do agents help with Technical SEO?", answer: "Agents can continuously monitor staging and production sites, running automated audits to identify broken links, missing tags, and performance regressions before they impact search rankings." },
    { question: "Can an agent manage my Google Ads?", answer: "Agents can analyze search term reports, identify irrelevant queries, and suggest negative keywords to save budget. However, a human should always approve final budget or targeting changes." },
    { question: "What is Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)?", answer: "AEO is the practice of structuring content so it can be easily ingested, understood, and cited by generative AI models and answer engines." },
    { question: "Are AI agents expensive to run?", answer: "They can be, as they consume tokens for reasoning and tool calling. Proper cost management, token monitoring, and using smaller models for simpler tasks are essential." },
    { question: "What is an infinite loop in agent execution?", answer: "An infinite loop occurs when an agent repeatedly fails to achieve an objective and keeps calling the same tools without progressing, consuming massive amounts of tokens." },
    { question: "Why is context compaction important?", answer: "LLMs have limited context windows. Compaction involves summarizing older interactions so the agent retains important knowledge without exceeding token limits or losing focus." },
    { question: "Can agents hallucinate tool calls?", answer: "Yes, agents can attempt to use tools they don't have or pass incorrect parameters. Strict input validation and clear error handling are required to mitigate this." },
    { question: "What is a Multi-Agent System (MAS)?", answer: "A MAS involves multiple specialized agents working together. For example, a research agent passing data to a writing agent, which then passes the draft to an editing agent." },
    { question: "Is n8n open source?", answer: "n8n is 'fair-code' distributed and source-available. It is highly flexible and can be self-hosted, but it has specific licensing requirements for commercial deployment." },
    { question: "How does n8n handle errors in workflows?", answer: "n8n allows you to create specific Error Trigger workflows that catch failures globally, enabling automated alerts to Slack, email, or ticketing systems." },
    { question: "What is the difference between short-term and long-term memory for agents?", answer: "Short-term memory tracks the current conversation session. Long-term memory usually involves vector databases allowing the agent to recall information from past sessions or documents." },
    { question: "Why shouldn't I use AI for financial calculations?", answer: "LLMs are probabilistic, meaning they predict the next most likely word; they are not calculators. For strict math, agents should be given access to a specific calculator tool or code node rather than doing the math natively." },
    { question: "What does 'graceful degradation' mean in agent design?", answer: "It means designing the system so that if a primary tool or API fails, the agent has a fallback plan or can clearly explain the failure to the user without crashing." },
    { question: "How can I monitor my agent's performance?", answer: "You should implement comprehensive audit logging, track token usage, and regularly review transcripts of the agent's reasoning processes to ensure it remains aligned with its goals." },
    { question: "Can I use n8n agents for social media management?", answer: "Yes, agents can analyze trending topics, generate multi-platform posts, and evaluate sentiment on brand mentions, routing negative comments to customer support." },
    { question: "What is Prompt Injection?", answer: "Prompt injection is a security vulnerability where external, malicious inputs trick the agent into ignoring its original instructions and executing unauthorized actions." },
    { question: "Do I need to know how to code to use n8n agents?", answer: "While n8n is a low-code platform and highly visual, understanding basic programming concepts, JSON, and API structures is essential for building complex, reliable agentic workflows." }

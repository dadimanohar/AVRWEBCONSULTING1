  faqs: [
    { question: "Are these case study results real?", answer: "Yes. Every figure comes from client Search Console, GA4 and CRM data, with baselines recorded before work started. Client names are withheld where permission was not granted." },
    { question: "How long before I see results like these?", answer: "Technical and on-page gains typically show within 30-60 days, ranking movement in 60-90 days, and compounding traffic or revenue growth from month four onward." },
    { question: "Do you have case studies in my industry?", answer: "We document e-commerce, SaaS, healthcare, legal, real estate and manufacturing here, and have delivered work in startups, education, travel, fashion and finance. Ask for relevant references." },
    { question: "What was the typical budget for these projects?", answer: "Engagements are tailored to project scope and competitiveness, typically scaling with content volume, location breadth, and technical complexity." },
    { question: "Did any of these clients get penalised later?", answer: "No. All work is manual and compliant with search engine spam policies, so gains have held through subsequent Google core updates." },
    { question: "How do you track AI assistant citations?", answer: "We run a fixed monthly prompt set across ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Claude and Google AI Overviews, logging whether the brand is named, linked or omitted." },
    { question: "Can you guarantee the same results for me?", answer: "No agency can guarantee specific rankings or revenue. We guarantee the method, the deliverables and transparent reporting against baselines we agree upfront." },
    { question: "Do you work with small budgets?", answer: "Yes. We design customized plans for single-location businesses who need local visibility as well as enterprise campaigns." },
    { question: "Will you show my business as a case study?", answer: "Only with your written permission, and we can anonymise the brand while keeping verified metrics." },
    { question: "How do I start a project like these?", answer: "Request an audit on the contact page. We benchmark your site against competitors and send priorities plus a tailored proposal within one business day." },

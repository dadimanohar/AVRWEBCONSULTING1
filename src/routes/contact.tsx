    { question: "Do you require long-term contracts?", answer: "No. Our retainers run month to month. We ask for a realistic runway of three to six months because SEO needs time, but you are never locked in." },
    { question: "What information should I include in my enquiry?", answer: "Your website URL, your main services and target locations, your competitors, current traffic or ranking issues, and your budget range if you have one." },
    { question: "Can we meet in person?", answer: `Yes, at our office: ${fullAddress}. Please book a time in advance so the right specialists are available.` },

    { question: "Who will I work with day to day?", answer: "A named account lead plus the specialists assigned to your work. All work is manual and in-house — we do not outsource delivery to unvetted third parties." },
    { question: "How do you handle access and confidentiality?", answer: "We request the minimum access needed, use delegated permissions rather than shared passwords, and sign an NDA on request before any data is shared." },

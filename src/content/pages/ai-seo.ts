    { question: "Is AI SEO different from traditional SEO?", answer: "It overlaps but is not identical. Traditional SEO competes for ranked links; AI SEO competes for inclusion inside a synthesised answer. Content format, entity consistency and structured data matter more, and success is measured in citations rather than positions." },
    { question: "Does AI SEO replace normal SEO?", answer: "No. Most assistants retrieve from live search results, so poor crawlability or weak authority still blocks you. AI SEO is a layer on top of technically sound, authoritative SEO." },
    { question: "How do you measure AI visibility?", answer: "We maintain a prompt set of real buyer questions and run it monthly across the major assistants, recording whether your brand is mentioned, cited with a link, described accurately, and how that compares to competitors." },
    { question: "How long does AI SEO take to show results?", answer: "Retrieval improvements from structured data and content reformatting can appear within 2–6 weeks. Entity and authority work — the part that makes models recommend you unprompted — typically takes three to six months." },
    { question: "Can you control what an AI says about my brand?", answer: "You cannot control it directly, but you can strongly influence it by publishing clear, consistent, well-structured facts about your business and getting those facts repeated on sources the models trust." },
    { question: "Should I block AI crawlers?", answer: "If you want AI visibility, no. Blocking GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot or Google-Extended removes you from those systems. We configure robots.txt deliberately so you allow the engines you want to appear in." },
    { question: "What is llms.txt?", answer: "llms.txt is a plain-text file at the root of a site that summarises what the site offers and links to key pages in a machine-friendly way. It is an emerging convention we implement as part of LLMO work." },

    { question: "How long should an answer paragraph be?", answer: "Between 40 and 60 words works best. It is long enough to be complete and short enough to be lifted whole into a snippet or AI summary without truncation." },
    { question: "Does FAQ schema still produce rich results?", answer: "Google reduced FAQ rich results for most sites, but FAQPage markup remains valuable because AI systems parse it when extracting question-answer pairs. We keep it for retrieval, not for the visual result." },
    { question: "How many FAQs should a page have?", answer: "We standardise on ten genuinely relevant questions per page. Fewer leaves coverage gaps; more usually means padding with questions nobody asks, which dilutes the page." },
    { question: "Can AEO help voice search?", answer: "Yes. Voice assistants read out a single answer, usually sourced from concise, well-structured passages, so the same formatting that wins snippets also wins voice results." },
    { question: "What content types work best for AEO?", answer: "Definitions, comparisons, pricing explanations, step-by-step processes, troubleshooting guides and 'how much / how long / what is' questions all convert well into extractable answers." },
    { question: "Do I need to change my whole website?", answer: "No. We start with the 10–20 pages that carry commercial intent, prove the pattern, then roll it across templates so new content is produced answer-first by default." },
    { question: "How quickly does AEO work?", answer: "Because it depends on re-crawling rather than authority building, AEO often shows movement in two to six weeks — faster than most SEO work." },
    { question: "Does AEO conflict with good writing?", answer: "No. Answer-first writing is simply clear writing: state the conclusion, then support it. Human readers prefer it too, which is why bounce rates usually improve." },

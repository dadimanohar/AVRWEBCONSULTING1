    { question: "Can I buy a one-off audit instead of an ongoing plan?", answer: "Yes. A full technical, on-page and AI visibility audit is available as a standalone deliverable, and that fee is credited if you start an ongoing plan within 30 days." },
    { question: "What results should I expect from our services?", answer: "Typically measurable technical and on-page gains in 30 days, first ranking movement in 60-90 days, and compounding traffic growth from month 4. Competitive national terms take longer." },
    { question: "Do prices include ad spend?", answer: "No. Management fees are separate from ad budget, which you pay directly to Google or Meta so you keep full ownership of the ad accounts." },

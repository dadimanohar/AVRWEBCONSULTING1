Code was often tabular, inline styling was the norm, and visual flair heavily outweighed usability. Today, that approach is obsolete. The paradigm has shifted entirely to a mobile-first, responsive, and performance-driven methodology."),

      question: "What are Core Web Vitals?",
      answer: "Core Web Vitals are a set of specific factors that Google considers important in a webpage's overall user experience. They consist of Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) for loading performance, Interaction to Next Paint (INP) for responsiveness, and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) for visual stability."
    },
    {
      question: "Why is mobile-first design so important?",
      answer: "Over half of all global web traffic comes from mobile devices. Furthermore, Google uses mobile-first indexing, meaning it predominantly uses the mobile version of the content for indexing and ranking. A site not optimized for mobile will suffer heavily in search results and user retention."
    },
    {
      question: "What is WCAG 2.2 and why does it matter?",
      answer: "WCAG 2.2 is a W3C Recommendation providing technical guidelines to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. It is organized around 4 principles: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust. Compliance ensures wider reach and protects against legal liabilities."
    },
    {
      question: "How does web design impact Google Ads?",
      answer: "Web design impacts the landing page experience, which is a major component of Google Ads Quality Score. A fast, relevant, and easy-to-navigate landing page results in a higher Quality Score, which lowers the cost-per-click and improves ad positioning."
    },
    {
      question: "Does modern web design guarantee better SEO rankings?",
      answer: "No. We do not guarantee rankings or conversion rates. However, modern web design provides the technical foundation—speed, mobile-friendliness, and clean structure—that is absolutely necessary to compete in search engine results."
    },
    {
      question: "What replaced First Input Delay (FID) in Core Web Vitals?",
      answer: "Interaction to Next Paint (INP) replaced FID. INP is a more comprehensive metric that assesses a page's overall responsiveness to user interactions throughout the entire lifecycle of the page, not just the first input."
    },
    {
      question: "What is semantic HTML?",
      answer: "Semantic HTML involves using HTML markup that reinforces the meaning of the information in webpages, rather than merely defining its presentation. Tags like <article>, <header>, and <nav> help search engines and screen readers understand the content structure."
    },
    {
      question: "How can I track my website's performance in AI search overviews?",
      answer: "By August 31, 2026, Google Search Console rolled out Search Generative AI performance reporting worldwide. You can use this feature within GSC to monitor impressions and clicks originating from AI-generated overviews."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the difference between UI and UX?",
      answer: "UI (User Interface) refers to the specific visual elements of a website, such as colors, typography, and buttons. UX (User Experience) is the broader concept of how a user feels and interacts with the site, encompassing navigation, speed, and overall flow."
    },
    {
      question: "How long should a modern website take to load?",
      answer: "Ideally, a webpage should load its main content (LCP) in 2.5 seconds or less to provide a good user experience and pass Core Web Vitals assessments."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the 'Bento Box' design trend?",
      answer: "The Bento Box layout is a UI trend that organizes content into distinct, grid-based compartments, similar to a Japanese bento box. It is highly structured, visually clean, and translates very well to responsive, mobile-first layouts."
    },
    {
      question: "Why should I avoid carousels on the homepage?",
      answer: "Carousels (or sliders) often hide important content, slow down page load times, and have notoriously low click-through rates. Modern design favors a strong, single hero image or video with a clear, direct message and CTA."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use AI to write all my website content?",
      answer: "While AI can assist in drafting content, relying entirely on unedited AI content is risky. Google emphasizes original, helpful content. AI content must be reviewed, fact-checked, and injected with human insight and brand voice to be effective."
    },
    {
      question: "What makes a CTA 'strong'?",
      answer: "A strong Call to Action (CTA) uses actionable, clear language (e.g., 'Get Your Free Quote' instead of 'Submit'), stands out visually with contrasting colors, and is placed strategically where the user is naturally ready to make a decision."
    },
    {
      question: "How frequently should a modern website be updated?",
      answer: "A modern website requires ongoing maintenance. Content should be updated regularly (weekly or monthly) for SEO, while technical updates (security patches, plugin updates, performance tweaks) should be handled on an ongoing, proactive basis."
    }

    {
      question: `How long does ${s.name.toLowerCase()} SEO take to show results?`,
      answer: `Technical and on-page fixes usually move impressions within 3–6 weeks. Meaningful ranking and enquiry growth typically lands in months 3–6, with compounding gains after that. Sites with existing authority move faster than new domains.`,

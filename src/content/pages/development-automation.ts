    { question: "How are credentials and data handled?", answer: "Credentials are stored in the platform's credential store rather than inside workflows, access is limited to what each connection needs, and we agree with you what data a workflow is allowed to move." },
    { question: "Can n8n work together with AI agents?", answer: "Yes. A common pattern is an AI agent interpreting a request and an n8n workflow carrying out the resulting actions in your connected applications." },
